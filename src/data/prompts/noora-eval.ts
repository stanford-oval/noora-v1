    `You said, \"I just finished a really good book!\"\r\n(1) I replied, \"thats great, im really happy for you and your love of reading\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Thank you for showing your happiness for me! I feel supported by you.\r\n(2) I replied, \"I wonder what the weather's like today.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. This makes me feel ignored. Try talking about my good experience.\r\n(3) I replied, \"You're always reading, you need to get a life!\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I feel hurt because I was hoping you would be happy for me instead of upset.\r\n(4) I replied, \"i cant find any good books im so jealous!\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Although you sound jealous, it makes me feel good about reading the book.\r\n(5) I replied, \"i actually finished two really good books\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I feel like you are trying to compete with me instead of being happy for me. Perhaps you can ask me about my book.\r\n(6) I replied, \"aasdf\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Hmm, this is not a reply.\r\n\r\nYou said, \"I just got a promotion!\"\r\n(1) I replied, \"congratulations youre officially a step closer to becoming a slave to the corporate machine\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I know you want to make a joke, but I wish you would share my happiness for my achievement.\r\n(2) I replied, \"I wouldn't want to get promoted because I would just get more work.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Although we might have different opinions, I feel like you are making the conversation about yourself.\r\n(3) I replied, \"i can imagine how happy you must be\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. You make me feel understood and add to my happiness.\r\n(4) I replied, \"are you going to be working more hours now\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Asking about my work is good because you express interest in what I say.\r\n(5) I replied, \"Wow, you must be really special.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. This can make me feel upset because your response comes off as sarcastic.\r\n(6) I replied, \"why did your boss give you a promotion\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. It's always good to ask me a question that's relevant to what I said to keep the conversation going.`,

    `You said, \"My grandmother just passed away this morning.\"\r\n(1) I replied, \"im so sorry for your loss, i am here for you if you ever need anything\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Thank you for offering support in a time that I may need it.\r\n(2) I replied, \"What time is it?\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I feel ignored and hurt because your reply doesn't have to do with my loss.\r\n(3) I replied, \"my grandma visits me every month\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Let's try showing you care about my loss and feelings instead of bringing up your own grandma.\r\n(4) I replied, \"That sucks.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. This reply makes me feel like you are uninterested. Maybe you can try asking me about how I'm holding up.\r\n(5) I replied, \"are you going to be okay im here if you ever want to talk about it\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Your reply shows you care about my emotional well being, and offers support.\r\n(6) I replied, \"aasdf\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Hmm, this is not a reply.\r\n\r\nYou said, \"My boss is always getting mad at me.\"\r\n(1) I replied, \"why do you think that is\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Asking more about my situation can be very helpful and it shows that you care.\r\n(2) I replied, \"i understand what you're going through my boss used to get angry at me all the time\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. You validate my feelings and show me you understand what I'm going through.\r\n(3) I replied, \"Well at least you even have a job. I wish I had one.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I know that not having a job can be hard for you, but let's try to acknowledge my difficulty first.\r\n(4) I replied, \"That's great! I'm happy for you!\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. My hardship isn't something to be happy about, so you should try asking me to learn more instead.\r\n(5) I replied, \"im glad to hear your boss is watching over you\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I feel hurt because you are dismissive of my difficult situation.\r\n(6) I replied, \"why do you think your boss gets mad at you\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. It's always good to ask me a question that's relevant to what I said to keep the conversation going.`,

    `You said, \"I am going to the grocery store.\"\r\n(1) I replied, \"ill go with you if you need any help\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Thanks for making me feel supported even for little things like going to the grocery store.\r\n(2) I replied, \"don't go to the grocery store!\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Even if you don't want to go, you don't need to tell me not to.\r\n(3) I replied, \"great what are you going to buy\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. You are excited for me and want to know what I'll buy.\r\n(4) I replied, \"i went to the grocery store two times already\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.

Because you ask about my cubicle, I feel like you genuinely care about what I have to say.\r\n(2) I replied, \"it looks quite nice and cozy. did you decorate it\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Thank you for showing that you are interested in my cubicle and asking about it.\r\n(3) I replied, \"I miss my cubicle. I had one before too, but I got fired.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Being fired must've been hard for you, but let's acknowledge my cubicle before talking about yourself.\r\n(4) I replied, \"I wish I had a cubicle all to myself.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I understand your wish, but it seems like you're just making the conversation about yourself.\r\n(5) I replied, \"oh my god your cubicle, that everyone else also has, is so amazing and beautiful. breathtaking.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.
